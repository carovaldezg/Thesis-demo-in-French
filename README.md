# Thesis-demo-in-French

This is a demo from Intellihome, my engineering thesis presented in April 2014 in UNCPBA, Tandil, Argentina. It is an 8 months project that I have developed alone, the formal software documentation and risk analysis is available in Spanish only and has 115 pages. 

Intellihome: A framework for the development of smart environments based in a client - server architecture, which support multi brand sensors such like Microsoft Kinect, Myo and Leap Motion.

With this project, you are able to transform a conventional environment in a smart environment using low cost technology. The main purpose of this work is to assist people with disabilities in their residences or works promoting the social inclusion.

The system allows its users to be their own remote control to control different appliances of their house or office, interacting with them naturally using HCI and natural user interfaces.

This project has been published as a research success case and presented in international conferences such as CLIHC: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2824913
and IADIS: http://www.iadisportal.org/digital-library/una-plataforma-para-el-desarrollo-de-ambientes-inteligentes-utilizando-sistemas-de-interfaz-natural-y-hardware-de-bajo-costo

Also, the project has been awarded by:

  - Microsoft and Dar foundation in their contests TEC 1 and TEC 2 during 2015,
  - Ministry of Sciences from Rep√∫blica Argentina in their contest Innovar 2015,
  - Municipality of Tandil City and Universities of Sciences and Economics in their contest Savia emprendedora 2015,
  - Municipality of Tandil and Grupo Assa in their contest Prendete 2015.
  

The uploaded demo is a small preview of the project and it was created to apply to Inria Internship program 2014, where I was chosen by 2 of the 3 projects I applied to. After this, I made the decision of becoming part of Team Spirals from Inria Nord Europe, Villeneuve d'asq, Nord pas de Calais, France, where I worked for 6 months in smart environments based in Android and Appisense, a crowd sensing platform.
